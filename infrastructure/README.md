# Infrastructure (MVP)

This directory documents how the lab is built and configured.

## Planned sections
- `firewall/` — FW01 setup, interfaces, baseline rules
- `ad/` — domain bootstrap, DNS, GPO notes
- `endpoints/` — Sysmon config, agent install
- `soc/` — Wazuh install, dashboards, onboarding

## Rule
Write steps so the lab can be reproduced from scratch.
